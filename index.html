         <h2 class="section1">Chicken</h2>
         <p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease 16- x 10-inch baking pan with oil.  In shallow bowl, mix together Parmesan, breadcrumbs, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Dip both sides of chicken and potato slices in mixture, shaking off any excess.
          Arrange chicken and potatoes in slightly overlapping rows in prepared pan; sprinkle with tomatoes and remaining breadcrumb mixture over top. Drizzle with oil.
          Bake for 45 minutes or until the potatoes are tender and chicken is cooked through.</p>

         <h2 class="section2">Beef</h2>
        <p>Curl pepper strip in center of each piece of beef; crumble provolone slice into center of pepper. Fold short ends of beef slightly over filling. Fold long ends over each other to create tight bundle. Secure ends with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining beef, peppers and provolone.
        Heat olive oil in large sauté pan set over high heat. Place beef bundles seam side down in pan; cook, turning once, for 6 minutes or until well browned. Reduce heat to low; partially cover pan and cook for 5 minutes.
        Transfer beef bundles to tray; set aside. Add wine to pan; increase heat to medium-high. Boil for 5 minutes or until wine is slightly reduced. Return beef bundles and any accumulated juices to pan; swirl pan to coat beef. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Remove toothpicks before serving.</p>

         <h2 class="section3">Sushi</h2>
         <p>Coat tuna with 1 tbsp olive oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Heat remaining olive oil in large heavy-bottomed skillet set over high heat until shimmering; cook tuna for 30 to 60 seconds per side or until seared on the outside but rare on the inside. Let tuna rest for 5 minutes before slicing across the grain.
          In large bowl, combine lettuce, cucumber, red pepper, celery and green onions; toss with vinaigrette. Divide salad among 4 plates; top with kimchee and sliced tuna. Garnish with sesame seeds.</p>
